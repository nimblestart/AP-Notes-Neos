Work, energy, and power are fundamental concepts in physics that describe how forces transfer energy to objects and how that energy is used or transformed.

## 3.1 Work

Work is done when a force causes a displacement of an object.

| **Concept**       | **Description**                                                          | **Equation/Key Points**                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Work**          | The product of force and displacement in the direction of the force.     | $W = F \cdot d \cdot \cos \theta$              |
| **Units**         | Work is measured in joules (J).                                          | $1 \, \text{J} = 1 \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}$ |
| **Positive Work** | Work is positive when force and displacement are in the same direction.  | $\theta < 90^\circ$                            |
| **Negative Work** | Work is negative when force and displacement are in opposite directions. | $\theta > 90^\circ$                            |
| **Zero Work**     | Work is zero when force and displacement are perpendicular.              | $\theta = 90^\circ$                            |

Potential energy is the energy stored due to an object's position or configuration.

| **Conservation of Energy**         | Total mechanical energy (KE + PE) remains constant in the absence of non-conservative forces. | $KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f$             |

Power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred.

| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Power**               | The rate of doing work.             | $P = \frac{W}{t}$                 |
| **Units**               | Power is measured in watts (W).     | $1 \, \text{W} = 1 \, \text{J/s}$ |
| **Instantaneous Power** | Power at a specific moment in time. | $P = F \cdot v$                   |

## 3.5 Conservation of Energy

Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

| **Concept**                 | **Description**                                            | **Equation/Key Points**                                |

| **Non-Conservative Forces** | Forces like friction that cause energy to be lost as heat. | $W_{\text{non-conservative}} = \Delta E_{\text{mech}}$ |

## 3.6 Work Done by Variable Forces

When the force is not constant, work is calculated using integration.

| **Concept**                | **Description**                                                    | **Equation/Key Points**           |

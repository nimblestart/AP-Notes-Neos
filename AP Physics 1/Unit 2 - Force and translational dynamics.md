Dynamics is the study of forces and how they affect the motion of objects. It builds on the concepts of kinematics by introducing the causes of motion.

## 2.1 Newton's Laws of Motion

| **Law**                  | **Description**                                                                 | **Equation/Key Points**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **First Law (Inertia)**   | An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by a net external force. | $\sum \vec{F} = 0 \Rightarrow \vec{a} = 0$                                             |
| **Second Law**            | The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to its mass. | $\sum \vec{F} = m \vec{a}$                                                             |
| **Third Law (Action-Reaction)** | For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.                      | $\vec{F}_{12} = -\vec{F}_{21}$                                                         |

## 2.2 Types of Forces

| **Force**                | **Description**                                                                 | **Equation/Key Points**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Gravitational Force**   | The force exerted by Earth (or any massive object) on another object.           | $\vec{F}_g = m \vec{g}$                                                                |
| **Normal Force**          | The force exerted by a surface to support an object. It acts perpendicular to the surface. | $\vec{F}_N$ is perpendicular to the surface.                                           |
| **Frictional Force**      | The force that opposes motion between two surfaces in contact.                  | - Static friction: $F_{f, \text{static}} \leq \mu_s F_N$ <br> - Kinetic friction: $F_{f, \text{kinetic}} = \mu_k F_N$ |
| **Tension**               | The force exerted by a string, rope, or cable.                                  | $\vec{T}$ acts along the direction of the string.                                       |
| **Applied Force**         | A force applied to an object by an external agent (e.g., pushing or pulling).    | $\vec{F}_{\text{applied}}$                                                             |

## 2.3 Free Body Diagrams
- A diagram showing all the forces acting on an object.
- Steps to Draw:
  1. Identify the object of interest.
  2. Draw all forces acting on the object as vectors.
  3. Label each force (e.g., $\vec{F}_g$, $\vec{F}_N$, $\vec{F}_f$).
  4. Break forces into components if necessary (e.g., on an incline).

## 2.4 Inclined Planes
Forces on an object on an inclined plane can be broken into components parallel and perpendicular to the surface.

| **Force Component**       | **Description**                                                | **Equation**                         |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Parallel to Incline**   | The component of gravity acting down the incline.             | $F_{g, \parallel} = mg \sin \theta$ |
| **Perpendicular to Incline** | The component of gravity acting perpendicular to the incline. | $F_{g, \perp} = mg \cos \theta$    |

## 2.5 Friction
Friction opposes motion and depends on the normal force and the coefficient of friction.

| **Type of Friction**      | **Description**                                                                 | **Equation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Static Friction**       | Prevents an object from moving when a force is applied.                         | $F_{f, \text{static}} \leq \mu_s F_N$                                      |
| **Kinetic Friction**      | Acts on an object in motion.                                                   | $F_{f, \text{kinetic}} = \mu_k F_N$                                        |

## 2.6 Centripetal Force
The net force directed toward the center of a circular path that causes circular motion.

| **Concept**               | **Description**                                                                 | **Equation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Centripetal Force**     | Required for circular motion.                                                   | $F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r} = m r \omega^2$                                      |
| **Centripetal Acceleration** | The acceleration directed toward the center of the circle.                    | $a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = r \omega^2$                                         |

## 2.7 Translational Equilibrium
- An object is in translational equilibrium when the net force acting on it is zero.
- **Condition:** $\sum \vec{F} = 0$
- **Implications:** The object is either at rest or moving with constant velocity.

## 2.8 Action-Reaction Pairs
- Forces always occur in pairs. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
- **Example:** When you push a wall, the wall pushes back on you with an equal force.

## 2.9 Applications of Newton's Laws
- **Atwood's Machine:** A system of two masses connected by a string over a pulley.
- **Pulleys:** Used to change the direction of a force.
- **Elevators:** Analyze forces when an elevator accelerates upward or downward.

Dynamics is the study of forces and how they affect the motion of objects. It builds on the concepts of kinematics by introducing the causes of motion.
#### 2.1 Newton's Laws of Motion

| **Law**                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Equation/Key Points**                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| <u>First Law (Inertia)</u>: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by a net external force.                                                          | $\sum \vec{F} = 0 \Rightarrow \vec{a} = 0$ |
| <u>Second Law</u>: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to its mass.                                                                       | $\sum \vec{F} = m \vec{a}$                 |
| <u>Third Law (Action-Reaction)</u>: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Forces always occur in pairs e.g., when you push a wall, the wall pushes back on you with an equal force. | $\vec{F}_{12} = -\vec{F}_{21}$             |
#### 2.2 Types of Forces

| **Force**                                                                                                       | **Equation/Key Points**                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <u>Gravitational Force</u>: The force exerted by Earth (or any massive object) on another object.               | $\vec{F}_g = m \vec{g}$                                                                                               |
| <u>Normal Force</u>: The force exerted by a surface to support an object. It acts perpendicular to the surface. | $\vec{F}_N$ is perpendicular to the surface.                                                                          |
| <u>Frictional Force</u>: The force that opposes motion between two surfaces in contact.                         | - Static friction: $F_{f, \text{static}} \leq \mu_s F_N$ <br> - Kinetic friction: $F_{f, \text{kinetic}} = \mu_k F_N$ |
| <u>Tension</u>: The force exerted by a string, rope, or cable.                                                  | $\vec{T}$ acts along the direction of the string.                                                                     |
| <u>Applied Force<u>: A force applied to an object by an external agent (e.g., pushing or pulling).              | $\vec{F}_{\text{applied}}$                                                                                            |
#### 2.3 Free Body Diagrams
- A diagram showing all the forces acting on an object.
- Steps to Draw:
  1. Identify the object of interest.
  2. Draw all forces acting on the object as vectors.
  3. Label each force (e.g., $\vec{F}_g$, $\vec{F}_N$, $\vec{F}_f$).
  4. Break forces into components if necessary (e.g., on an incline).

#### 2.4 Inclined Planes
Forces on an object on an inclined plane can be broken into components parallel and perpendicular to the surface.

| **Force Component**                                                                            | **Equation**                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| <u>Parallel to Incline</u>: The component of gravity acting down the incline.                  | $F_{g, \parallel} = mg \sin \theta$ |
| <u>Perpendicular to Incline</u>: The component of gravity acting perpendicular to the incline. | $F_{g, \perp} = mg \cos \theta$     |
#### 2.5 Friction
Friction opposes motion and depends on the normal force and the coefficient of friction.

| **Type of Friction**                                                            | **Equation**                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| <u>Static Friction</u>: Prevents an object from moving when a force is applied. | $F_{f, \text{static}} \leq \mu_s F_N$ |
| <u>Kinetic Friction</u>: Acts on an object in motion.                           | $F_{f, \text{kinetic}} = \mu_k F_N$   |
#### 2.6 Centripetal Force
The net force directed toward the center of a circular path that causes circular motion.

| **Concept**                                                                                 | **Equation**                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| <u>Centripetal Force</u>: Required for circular motion.                                     | $F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r} = m r \omega^2$ |
| <u>Centripetal Acceleration</u>: The acceleration directed toward the center of the circle. | $a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = r \omega^2$    |
#### 2.7 Translational Equilibrium
- An object is in translational equilibrium when the net force acting on it is zero.
- **Condition:** $\sum \vec{F} = 0$
- **Implications:** The object is either at rest or moving with constant velocity.

#### 2.8 Applications of Newton's Laws
- **Atwood's Machine:** A system of two masses connected by a string over a pulley.
- **Pulleys:** Used to change the direction of a force.
- **Elevators:** Analyze forces when an elevator accelerates upward or downward.

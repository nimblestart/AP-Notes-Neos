Kinematics is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. It focuses on describing motion using quantities like displacement, velocity, and acceleration.
## 1.1 Scalars and Vectors
- **Scalar:** A quantity with magnitude only (e.g., speed, distance, mass).
- **Vector:** A quantity with both magnitude and direction (e.g., velocity, displacement, acceleration, force).
- **Component Vectors:** If a vector is at an angle use trigonometric functions to get the x and y components. Remember to use the correct angle and appropriate Trig function. e.g. $\sin(\theta) = \frac{O}{H} \quad \Rightarrow \quad A_x = A \sin(\theta)$. 
## 1.2 Distance, and Speed
- **Distance:** Distance is how far something moves and it includes the path travelled.
- **Speed:** $\frac{distance}{time}$

## 1.4 Equations of Motion (UAM - Uniformly Accelerated Motion)
These equations apply when acceleration is constant.

## 1.6 Free Fall
- Acceleration due to gravity ($g$): $g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$ (downward direction is negative).
- In free fall, the only force acting on the object is gravity (ignoring air resistance).
- Equations of motion apply with $a = -g$.
## 1.7 Projectile Motion
Projectile motion is the motion of an object launched into the air, subject only to gravity.
### Key Points:
- The horizontal and vertical motions are independent.
- Horizontal motion: Constant velocity ($a_x = 0$).
- Vertical motion: Constant acceleration ($a_y = -g$).
### Equations:
Horizontal displacement: $\Delta x = v_{x0} t$

| Horizontal displacement | $\Delta x = v_{x0} t$                                      |
| Vertical displacement   | $\Delta y = v_{y0} t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2$                  |
| Time of flight          | $t = \frac{2 v_{y0}}{g}$ (for symmetric projectile motion) |
## 1.8 Relative Motion
- The motion of an object as observed from a different frame of reference
- Relative velocity: $\vec{v}_{\text{A relative to B}} = \vec{v}_{\text{A}} - \vec{v}_{\text{B}}$
